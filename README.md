>    My name is Corey Carter, and I am a
Computer Science major with goals to get a Ph.D.
in the same field, studying AI (Artificial
Intelligence) and Cybersecurity. I started learning
the field of computer science during a Google
coding internship program named Google Code
Next. From there, the rest is history, as I have
learned many different coding languages such as
Java, Python, and more. Some of the projects I
have worked on include different websites and
robots. For example, I am currently working on a
Machine learning model that correctly produces
CWL code for the bio informatics field. I have also collaborated with others on
coding projects; however, these projects were for classroom assignments. The
computer science classes I have taken so far are Computer Science 1, 2, and 3,
Assembly Language, Digital Logic, Language Processing, Operating Systems and
more. This semester, I'm taking your class(again), an honors class, and some other
computer science classes.
>    By taking this course(again), I see myself improving my coding skills and
learning new skills. Thus, making me a strong coder and problem solver. So, with
that, I'm going to take what I learn from this class and apply it to either current
projects that I have in mind or future projects or jobs.
